# -Circuits-Project
The project focuses on the design and development of a signal conditioning circuit for piezoelectric sensors, aimed at converting physical forces into measurable electrical signals. The system enhances the signalâ€™s readability by utilizing amplification and filtering techniques, allowing for accurate detection of weight and movement.
